# CodeAlpha_Iris_Classification
 Iris Flower Classification with Machine Learning:

This project uses a simple machine learning model to classify Iris flowers into three species — Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica — based on their sepal and petal dimensions.


 Task Description:
 Iris flowers can be identified using four features:
  . Sepal Length
  . Sepal Width
  . Petal Length
  . Petal Width
The objective is to train a machine learning model that can predict the species of an Iris flower based on these measurements.




Technologies Used:
. Python
. pandas
. numpy
. seaborn
. matplotlib
. scikit.learn
. joblib


Machine Learning Algorithm:
. Logistic Regression was used to train the classification model.
. Model is saved as `iris_model.pkl` for future use.

Project Workflow:
1. Data Loading from URL
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using visualizations
3. Data Preparation (features and target separation)
4. Train.Test Split
5. Model Training using Logistic Regression
6. Model Evaluation using accuracy score, classification report, and confusion matrix
7. Model Saving using joblib

...

Results:
. The model achieved high accuracy on the test set.
. Evaluation includes
  1. Accuracy Score
  2. Classification Report
  3.  Confusion Matrix (visualized using Seaborn)
